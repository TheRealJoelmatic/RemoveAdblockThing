## Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey**:
   If you haven't already, you need to install the Tampermonkey browser extension. You can find it for various browsers:
   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
   - [Tampermonkey for Opera/OperaGX](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

2. **Install the Script**:
   [Click Here and Press Install](Youtube-Ad-blocker-Reminder-Remover.user.js?raw=True).

3. **Enable the Script**:
   Enable the script by clicking the switch next to the script name in the Tampermonkey Dashboard.

4. **Disable your adblocker**:
   Whitelist YouTube on any Chrome extensions that block ads or any third-party things that disable ads. Don't worry; our script removes ads on YouTube.


Note: This also allows you to watch videos when your video player is banned from using an adblock.

## Common Issues

**"Ad Blockers violate Youtube Terms Of Service" OR Just a black screen**

This happens when there is an adblock other than the script running. Common ways you may be blocking ads accidentally on Youtube is:

- **Adblock extension:** Disable or whitelist YouTube on your ad blocker extension.

- **Browser built-in adblock:** Some browsers have built-in ad blockers. Disable or configure them.

- **Other Tampermonkey scripts:** Scripts like YouTube enhancer may conflict. Disable them one by one to identify the issue.

- **Wi-Fi/DNS/Firewall adblock rules:** Check network settings for any ad-blocking configurations.

- **Windows hosts file rules:** Inspect the Windows hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc) for ad-blocking rules.
