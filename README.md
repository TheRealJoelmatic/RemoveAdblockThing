## Introduction

This repository contains a userscript designed to remove the annoying "Ad blocker is not allowed on Youtube" popup. Follow the instructions below to get started. We also have an undetected way of skipping ads if you get blocked from the video player.

## Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey**:
   If you haven't already, you need to install the Tampermonkey browser extension. You can find it for various browsers:
   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
   - [Tampermonkey for Opera/OperaGX](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

2. **Install the Script**:
   [Click Here and Press Install](Youtube-Ad-blocker-Reminder-Remover.user.js?raw=True).

3. **Enable the Script**:
   Enable the script by clicking the switch next to the script name in the Tampermonkey Dashboard.

4. **Disable your adblocker**:
   Whitelist YouTube on any Chrome extensions that block ads or any third-party things that disable ads. Don't worry; our script removes ads on YouTube.


Note: This also allows you to watch videos when your video player is banned from using an adblock.


## Usage

Once you've installed and enabled the userscript, it should start working automatically. Enjoy.
